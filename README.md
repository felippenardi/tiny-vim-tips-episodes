# Tiny Vim Tips animated gifs

This repository contains the PSD source files of the novelty animated gifs I make for the **Tiny Vim Tips** newsletter.

## Example

## How does gifs are made
* Open an specifc iTerm profile I created of the right terminal size and font
* Use **Uber Layer** app to mask the default's OSX window look with `terminal_mask.png`
* Record them with LICEcap
* Open the creatd gif in Photoshop and edit it
